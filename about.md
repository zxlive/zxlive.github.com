The Open Institute for Advanced Study is so far just a blog with ideas about collaborative research.

But as the pompous name implies there is no end to the underlying ambition: to create an online
institute, modeled after the [Institute for Advanced Study](http://www.ias.edu) in that it is not
a graduate school training students in the known and in the methods of research,
but rather an institute where everyone takes for granted what is known and published, and, each in
their own individual way, endeavor to advance the frontiers of knowledge. If this nascent institute
ever comes to life it will distinguish itself from those before it by welcoming everyone to join its
ranks, work collaboratively on research and partake in the scientific discussion, whether they are a
tenured professor or still in high school.
